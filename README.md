# 🎭 Understudy — One AI, Every Role

> A system that configures specialized AI agents in any project.
> One assistant, multiple roles: Architect, Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Security, QA.
> Compatible with **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **VS Code**, **Claude Code** and **Cursor**.

## Installation

**One-liner** (Linux, macOS, Windows Git Bash / WSL):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erniker/understudy/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release, installs it to `~/.understudy/` and adds the
`understudy` command to your PATH.

**Specific version:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erniker/understudy/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --version v1.0.0
```

**Manual (clone):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erniker/understudy.git
cd understudy
chmod +x wizard.sh
```

> See [install options](#install-options) for `--dir`, `--no-path` and `--uninstall`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy Understudy in any project
cd /path/to/your/project
understudy
# → Choose platforms: Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor

# Then open your AI tool
claude            # Claude Code
copilot           # GitHub Copilot CLI
cursor .          # Cursor
```

### Install options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--version <tag>` | Install a specific version (e.g. `v1.2.0`) |
| `--dir <path>` | Custom install directory (default: `~/.understudy`) |
| `--no-path` | Skip PATH setup |
| `--uninstall` | Remove Understudy from the system |

### Automatic update checks

When you run `understudy`, it checks for a new release on GitHub.
If a newer version exists, it asks whether you want to update now.

To disable this check (for CI or offline environments):

```bash
export UNDERSTUDY_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1
```

## What is this?

A system that automatically generates all the configuration needed for
**GitHub Copilot CLI**, **VS Code**, **Claude Code** and **Cursor** to work as a complete development team:

| Member | Role | Expertise |
|---|---|---|
| 🏛️ **Architect** | Solutions Architect | System design, APIs, databases, cloud |
| ⚙️ **Backend** | Backend Developer | .NET, Node.js, C#, TypeScript, Python, Bash |
| 🎨 **Frontend** | Frontend Developer | React, TypeScript, UX/UI, accessibility |
| 🚀 **DevOps** | DevOps Engineer | Azure, AWS, Docker, K8s, Terraform, CI/CD |
| 🔒 **Security** | Security Expert | OWASP, threat modeling, compliance, IAM |
| 🧪 **QA** | QA Engineer | Testing .NET, Node.js, Python, E2E, contract testing |

## Key Concepts

### 1. AGENTS.md — "Who is the team"
A file at the project root that defines agents selectable with `/agent` in Copilot CLI.
Each agent has a name, role, expertise and behavioral rules.

### 2. .github/copilot-instructions.md — "Project rules"
Global instructions that Copilot loads **automatically** in every session.
Defines project context, conventions and workflow.

### 3. .github/instructions/*.instructions.md — "How each member works"
Modular instruction files per role. Activated with `/instructions`
or loaded alongside the corresponding agent. They contain the detailed personality,
code standards and checklists for each member.

### 4. Parallel sub-agents — "Divide and conquer"
Copilot CLI can launch sub-agents (task tool) that work in parallel.
Ideal for Backend and Frontend to implement simultaneously while
DevOps prepares the infrastructure.

### 5. Context files — "Memory between sessions"
The files `docs/session-log.md`, `docs/spec.md` and `docs/decisions.md`
act as persistent memory. At the start of each session the agent reads them;
at the end, it updates them. This saves tokens and avoids repeating information.

### 6. 🛡️ Guardrails — "What we NEVER do"
Security and behavioral limits that all agents respect.
They cover 8 categories: security, scope, process, destructive operations,
data/PII, quality, environments and documentation. They are **non-negotiable** and
deployed automatically with the wizard.

### 7. 🔒 Local-only mode — "Keep AI config out of git"
Optional. The wizard can append the generated AI config (`AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/instructions/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`…) and/or the
session memory files (`docs/spec.md`, `docs/decisions.md`,
`docs/session-log.md`) to the project's `.gitignore` so they stay local.
Useful in corporate repos where AI tool config is private, or open source
projects where you don't want to expose your internal workflow. Toggle with
`git.local_config` / `git.local_memory` in `understudy.yaml` — see
[docs/09-configuration.md](docs/09-configuration.md#local-only-mode).

## Guardrails

Guardrails protect the team from:
- Secrets or sensitive data leaks
- Destructive operations without confirmation
- Production changes without change control
- Code without spec, without tests, or without review
- Scope violations between agents

### Deployment modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔀 **split** (recommended) | Critical guardrails always active in `copilot-instructions.md` + full details file in `guardrails.instructions.md` |
| 📦 **embedded** | Only critical guardrails embedded in `copilot-instructions.md` (lighter, no separate file) |

### Split vs Embedded: practical differences

| Aspect | 🔀 split | 📦 embedded |
|---|---|---|
| **Enforcement level** | Critical guardrails are always active **and** full guardrails are available in a dedicated file | Only critical guardrails are always active |
| **Visibility** | Higher: team can review complete guardrails in `guardrails.instructions.md` | Lower: only the reduced set is visible in global instructions |
| **Maintenance** | Easier to evolve full guardrails without bloating global instructions | Simpler file structure, but less room for detailed policies |
| **Best for** | Regulated teams, larger repos, multi-agent workflows, stricter governance | Small/fast projects, lightweight setups, teams that want minimal overhead |
| **Trade-off** | More files and a bit more structure | Less explicit coverage of non-critical rules |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Choose **split** when you want stronger governance, better auditability and clearer team alignment.
- Choose **embedded** when speed and simplicity matter more than policy depth.

The mode is selected during the wizard and can be changed by editing `understudy.yaml`:

```yaml
guardrails:
  mode: "split"   # "split" or "embedded"
```

### Categories

| # | Category | What it protects |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🛡️ Security | No secrets, no bypass, mandatory input validation |
| 2 | 🎯 Scope | File ownership per agent, justification required to cross boundaries |
| 3 | 📋 Process | Spec-first (with exceptions for bugfixes/emergencies), documented decisions |
| 4 | 💥 Destructive | PM confirmation before deleting, purging or revoking |
| 5 | 🔒 Data/PII | No real data, synthetic data in tests, GDPR |
| 6 | 🏗️ Quality | Self-review, appropriate tests, naming, error handling |
| 7 | ⚠️ Environments | Promotion order dev→prd, mandatory IaC, no manual changes |
| 8 | 📝 Documentation | ADRs, session-log, updated spec |

## Wizard Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `understudy` | Full interactive deployment |
| `understudy --add-member` | Add a team member (data engineer, QA, etc.) |
| `understudy --create-role` | Create a custom role from scratch |
| `understudy --help` | Show help |

> If you installed manually via `git clone`, replace `understudy` with `./wizard.sh`.

## Integration into Existing Projects and Monorepos

The wizard automatically detects existing projects and adapts:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| 🆕 Folder doesn't exist | Creates new project with full structure |
| 🔄 Existing project | Integrates Understudy without touching existing files |
| ⚠️ Already has Understudy | Re-deploy: only adds missing files |

### Automatic Stack Detection

The wizard scans up to 3 levels deep to detect technologies:

| Technology | Marker | Example |
|---|---|---|
| .NET | `*.csproj`, `*.sln` | `.NET: services/api-customers (ApiCustomers)` |
| Node.js | `package.json` (without React/Vue/Angular) | `Node.js: services/api-notifications` |
| React | `package.json` with `"react"` | `React: frontend/web-app` |
| Vue | `package.json` with `"vue"` | `Vue: frontend/admin` |
| Angular | `package.json` with `"@angular/core"` | `Angular: frontend/portal` |
| Python | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` | `Python: services/ml-scoring` |
| Terraform | `*.tf` | `Terraform: infra/terraform` |
| Docker | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | `Docker: 4 Dockerfiles` |

### Monorepo Support

When 2+ independent projects are detected, the stack is labeled as **Monorepo**:

```
Monorepo: .NET(2) + Node.js + React(2) + Python + Terraform + Docker

Components found:
  • .NET: services/api-customers (ApiCustomers)
  • .NET: services/api-policies (ApiPolicies)
  • React: frontend/web-app
  • Node.js: services/api-notifications
  • Python: services/ml-scoring
  • Terraform: infra/terraform
  • Docker: 4 Dockerfiles
  • Docker Compose: ./
```

The detected stack is pre-filled as the default value, saving you time during setup.

```

## How to Add New Roles

The `roles/` folder is the **official optional roles catalog** for the system. The 6 core roles (Architect, Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Security, QA) are always deployed from `templates/`; roles in `roles/` are additional and you choose them.

**Included optional roles:**

| Role | When to use it |
|---|---|
| 📊 **data-engineer** | ETL/ELT pipelines, data warehouses, streaming, data governance |
| 📱 **mobile-engineer** | iOS/Android apps, React Native, Flutter |
| 🤖 **ml-engineer** | ML models, MLOps, LLMs, RAG, responsible AI |
| 📝 **tech-writer** | Technical documentation, API docs, tutorials, Diataxis |
| 🧭 **sre** | SLOs, observability, incident response, chaos engineering |

**How to add them:**

1. **From the existing catalog**: `understudy --add-member` → choose from menu
2. **Create a new one**: `understudy --create-role` → saved in `roles/` for reuse
3. **Manual**: create a file `name.instructions.md` in `roles/` following the existing format

> Roles you create with `--create-role` are stored in `roles/` and will be available for **all your future Understudy deployments**, not just the current project.

## Tips for Project Managers

- Use **Claude Opus** (`/model`) for the Architect — better reasoning for design
- Use **Claude Sonnet** for Backend/Frontend — good speed/quality balance
- Use **Claude Haiku** for quick DevOps tasks — economical and efficient
- Always ask to update `session-log.md` at the end of each session
- The spec is sacred: if scope changes, update the spec first

> These defaults are in `understudy.yaml`. Edit it in your project to customize.

## Configuration and Override

The system uses an `understudy.yaml` configuration file with priority hierarchy:

```
1. Wizard defaults (built-in)                    ← lowest priority
2. ~/.understudy/understudy.yaml (installed)     ← global defaults
   OR understudy.yaml next to wizard.sh (cloned) ← if installed manually
3. understudy.yaml in the project                ← per-project override (highest)
```

Example override: your project needs Opus for Security because it's fintech:
```yaml
# my-project/understudy.yaml
models:
  security: "claude-opus-4.6"   # override: more reasoning for fintech
platforms:
  copilot: true
  claude: true                  # or false if you only use one platform
  cursor: true
guardrails:
  mode: "embedded"              # override: only critical guardrails for lighter project
```

## Compatibility: Copilot CLI + VS Code + Claude Code + Cursor

Understudy works on **all four platforms** — choose one or all during deployment:

| Feature | Copilot CLI | VS Code | Claude Code | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Global instructions | ✅ Auto-loaded | ✅ Auto-loaded | ✅ CLAUDE.md | ✅ `.cursor/rules/` |
| Role instructions | ✅ `/instructions` | ✅ Auto-applies by `applyTo` | ✅ `.claude/agents/` | ✅ `.cursor/agents/` |
| Guardrails | ✅ Auto + `/instructions` | ✅ Auto-applies (`**`) | ✅ CLAUDE.md + hooks | ✅ `guardrails.mdc` |
| Agent selection | `/agent` | Chat with context | Invoke by name | Agent panel |
| Reusable prompts | N/A | ✅ `.github/prompts/` | ✅ `/project:command` | N/A |
| Team definition | ✅ AGENTS.md | ✅ AGENTS.md | ✅ `.claude/agents/` | ✅ `.cursor/agents/` |
| File protection | N/A | N/A | ✅ `settings.json` deny | N/A |
| Security hooks | N/A | N/A | ✅ `.claude/hooks/` | N/A |

### In VS Code
- Instructions are applied **automatically** based on the file you're editing
  (thanks to the `applyTo` frontmatter in each `.instructions.md`)
- Prompts in `.github/prompts/` are available as reusable prompts
- Use "Start Session" and "End Session" prompts for the context flow

### In Claude Code
- `CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically when you open the project
- Agents are in `.claude/agents/` — invoke them by name
- Commands are in `.claude/commands/` — use them with `/project:name`
- The guardrails hook blocks destructive operations automatically
- `settings.json` protects sensitive files (.env, keys, secrets)

### In Cursor
- Global rules (`.cursor/rules/`) are applied **automatically** in every session
- Agents are in `.cursor/agents/` — invoke them from the Agent panel
- Guardrails are in `.cursor/rules/guardrails.mdc` — always active
- Each agent has its model configured in the frontmatter (`auto`, `fast`, or a specific model)

### Files by platform

**Copilot / VS Code:**
```
.github/copilot-instructions.md        → Always active (includes critical guardrails)
.github/instructions/*.instructions.md → By file type (applyTo)
.github/instructions/guardrails.instructions.md → Always active (applyTo: "**")
.github/prompts/*.prompt.md            → Invocable from Copilot Chat
AGENTS.md                              → Read as context
```

**Claude Code:**
```
CLAUDE.md                              → Always active (includes critical guardrails)
.claude/agents/*.md                    → Agents by role (with frontmatter)
.claude/commands/*.md                  → Commands (/project:name)
.claude/settings.json                  → Permissions and hooks
.claude/hooks/guardrails-check.sh      → Hook PreToolUse
```

**Cursor:**
```
.cursor/agents/*.md                    → Agents by role (with frontmatter)
.cursor/rules/understudy-global.mdc        → Global rules (always active)
.cursor/rules/guardrails.mdc          → Guardrails (always active)
```
